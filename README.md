This is my first published Slay The Spire mod. I made this because it seemed like it could be fun and for content! Many of these relics are inspired by idioms and references to friends, there may be a few that are a bit strong. A number of these relics may make the game a bit easier, but the point is to have fun! A lot of them are rare because they are kind of strong.

All the relic information is on the Steam Page as well!
